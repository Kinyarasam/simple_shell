# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

## Concepts
For this project, students are expected to look at this concepts:
* [Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/64)
* [Approaching a Project](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/350)

## Background Context
Write a simple UNIX command interpreter.

## Resources

#### Read or watch:

- [Unix shell]()
- [Thompson shell]()
- [Ken Thompson]()
- __Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell__ concept page

#### man or help:
* `sh` (*Run `sh` as well*)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](), **without the help of Google:**

### General
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language(the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is thte difference between the function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of `main`
* How does shell use the `PATH` to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the `execve` system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is `EOF` / "end-of-file"?

- All your files should end on a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using the [betty-style.pl]() and [betty-doc.pl]()
- Your code should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to ([why?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-system-calls-expensive-in-operating-systems))
- Write a `README` with the description of your project
- You should have an `AUTHORS` file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see [Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/AUTHORS)

### GitHub
_\*There should be one project repository per group. If you and your partner have a repository with the same name in both your accounts, you risk a 0% score. Add your partner as a collaborator.*_
